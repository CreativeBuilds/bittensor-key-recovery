# Bittensor Key Recovery

Small helper utility to decrypt a `$NACL`-encrypted cold-key file generated by the [Bittensor](https://bittensor.com) wallet and recover its private data (seed, mnemonic, SS58 address).

## Features

* Offline, single-file script (`decrypt.py`)
* Compatible with cold-key files produced by any Bittensor wallet version that stores keys in `$NACL` format
* Uses only two lightweight dependencies (`pynacl`, `substrate-interface`)

## Installation

```bash
# clone the repo
$ git clone https://github.com/your-username/bittensor-key-recovery.git
$ cd bittensor-key-recovery

# (optional) use a virtual environment
$ python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate

# install dependencies
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```bash
$ python decrypt.py ~/.bittensor/wallets/<wallet-name>/coldkey
Cold-key password: ********

✓  decrypted
Seed (hex) : 0x…
SS58 addr  : …
Mnemonic   : …
```

* Provide the path to the **coldkey** file (not `coldkey.pub`).
* Enter the cold-key password when prompted.
* If the password is correct the script prints the private seed in hex, its mnemonic representation and the derived SS58 address.

## Security Notice

The script never transmits your password or keys. Still, treat the recovered seed/mnemonic as highly sensitive: anyone with this information can control your Bittensor funds.
